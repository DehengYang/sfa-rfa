## Introduction
In our experiment, we obtained 48 versions of repair tools (6 SFl * 2 statement selecting strategies * 4 repair tools = 48 versions of repair tools). And then run 100 independent repeated repair trials on each benchmark program. The total time cost is up to 2 and a half months.

The result data of NCP and patch diversity can be found in this folder.

## Instructions of Plotting Figures
To get the figures and results of statistcal tests presented in our paper:
1) Open the folder "Nopol", and run ```runAll.m``` and ```strategy2RunCompare.m``` respectively;
2) Open the folder "Astor/jKali", and run ```runAll.m```;
3) Open the folder "Astor/jMutRepair", and run ```runAll.m```;
4) Open the folder "SimFix", and run ```runAll.m```.
